# Laravel Homestead PHP56

* Forked from https://github.com/laravel/homestead

Also I set this up so I could run it along side my PHP7 box if I wanted, this means this script uses ~/.homestead-56 as a setup directory so you'll still need to run `bash ~/init.sh`. The IP address is left the same so you'll need to halt any other homstead boxes running, then start this vagrant box with `cd; vagrant up`.
